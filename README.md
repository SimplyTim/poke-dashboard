# Motivation

Target audience: Pok√©mon Novices

Pok√©mon is a franchise that has existed since 1996 and is well-loved by all ages. As per Generation 8, there were **close to 900** different Pok√©mon, which could be a bit intimidating to new-comers of the franchise. A **Pok√©Dex** is a device in the Pok√©mon world that gives information about each Pok√©mon. This dashboard seeks to achieve this, aimed at novices of the franchise to learn a bit about the different types Pok√©mon and motivating them to dive deeper into the video games and even trading cards. Even Pok√©mon experts can enjoy this fun dashboard, which gives a GIF, brief description, basic information, base stats and type matchups for each Pok√©mon!

Gotta catch 'em all!
